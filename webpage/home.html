                        for major financial institution in El Salvador but 
                        sought a more rewarding career in crypto as a very 
                        talented illustrator and we are happy that he is able 
                        to expand his presence further beyond the country's 
                        borders. <span>@ackermann.eth</span> is the lead blockchain developing

                        mega flippers and we donâ€™t have vast teams of influencers 
                        and big names at our disposal. Weâ€™re just 5 ordinary folks 
                        from third-world countries whoâ€™ve managed to stumble upon 
                        something truly remarkable.

                    <p>When did this project came to life?</p>
                    <p>
                        The artist started with the first sketches 
                        in early September 2021. It took him quite 
                        some time to finalize all the attributes and 
                        determining the rarity of the individual 
                        attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>What is the total supply?</p>
                    <p>
                        A total of 1821 unique CryptoPresis NFTs will 
                        be created. The total supply of the NFTs was 
                        inspired by the year of independence of 
                        El Salvador.
                    </p>
                    <p>When is the launch?</p>
                    <p>
                        We will announce the date of the drop in a 
                        future announcement. Stay tuned!
                    </p>
                    <p>How much does it cost to mint an NFT?</p>
                    <p>
                        0.04 ETH + gas. We will develop a mint mechanism 
                        to protect our community from paying high gas 
                        fees to mint our collection. Stay tuned for

                        CryptoPresis is a collection of 1821 algorithmically 
                        generated art pieces inspired by the President of El 
                        Salvador, Nayib Bukele. The first NFT project made by 
                        El Salvador for the world. The collection focuses on 
                        furthering education on crypto throughout El Salvador 
                        and donating to charitable organization such as Bitcoin 
                        Beach to increase further outreach and introduce our 
                        people and inspire other artists to the world of NFTs.

                        for major financial institution in El Salvador but 
                        sought a more rewarding career in crypto as a very 
                        talented illustrator and we are happy that he is able 
                        to expand his presence further beyond the country's 
                        borders. <span>@ackermann.eth</span> is the lead blockchain developing

                        can for our holders. We’re not millionaires, we’re not 
                        mega flippers and we don’t have vast teams of influencers 
                        and big names at our disposal. We’re just 5 ordinary folks 
                        from third-world countries who’ve managed to stumble upon 
                        something truly remarkable.

                    <p>When did this project came to life?</p>
                    <p>
                        The artist started with the first sketches 
                        in early September 2021. It took him quite 
                        some time to finalize all the attributes and 
                        determining the rarity of the individual 
                        attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>What is the total supply?</p>
                    <p>
                        A total of 1821 unique CryptoPresis NFTs will 
                        be created. The total supply of the NFTs was 
                        inspired by the year of independence of 
                        El Salvador.
                    </p>
                    <p>When is the launch?</p>
                    <p>
                        We will announce the date of the drop in a 
                        future announcement. Stay tuned!
                    </p>
                    <p>How much does it cost to mint an NFT?</p>
                    <p>
                        0.04 ETH + gas. We will develop a mint mechanism 
                        to protect our community from paying high gas 
                        fees to mint our collection. Stay tuned for 
                        more information.

                    <p>How many can I mint during the sale?</p>
                    <p>TBD</p>
